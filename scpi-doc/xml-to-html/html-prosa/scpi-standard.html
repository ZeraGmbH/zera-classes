        The <b>S</b>tandard <b>C</b>ommands for <b>P</b>rogrammable <b>I</b>nstruments (SCPI) defines
        syntax and commands to control test and measurement devices. While originally created for
        IEEE-488 (GPIB), it can also be used with RS232, USB, Ethernet etc.<br/>
        SCPI is organized as a hierarchical tree of nodes. Root nodes are called instrument models.
    </p>
    Some specifications of SCPI standard are as below: <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The short form of the node name is usually the first four characters of the long form command header.
            The exception to this is when the long form consists of more than four characters and the fourth character is a vowel.
            In such cases, the vowel is dropped and the short form becomes the first three characters of the long form.
            <br/>
            Examples: SENSE -> SENS; DEVICE -> DEV;
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            The <b>colon</b> (:) is a path hierarchy separator.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            A <b>semicolon</b> (;) indicates end of a command with parameter(s).
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <b>Queries</b> (?) will instruct the instrument to send a response message.
            Queries return either measured values or internal instrument settings.<br/>
            <b>Caution:</b> If you send two query commands without reading the response of the first
            query, the first response will get lost as the device recognizes an interrupted action.
            In this case the query error bit in the standard event status register will also be set.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            A <b>comma</b> (,) is used to separate parameters if a command requires more than one
            parameter.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <b>Whitespace</b> (space) must be used to separate a parameter from a command
            keyword.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <b>Common Commands</b> (*) follow the IEEE-488.2 interface standard. These
            commands are used to control reset, self-test, and status operations in a device.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li> 
            <b>Input Message Terminators</b>: Program messages sent to a SCPI instrument must
            terminate with a &lt;linefeed&gt; character. The IEEE-488 EOI signal is interpreted
            as a &lt;linefeed&gt; character.
        </li>
    </ul>
