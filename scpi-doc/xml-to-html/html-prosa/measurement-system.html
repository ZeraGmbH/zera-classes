        There are three <b>atomic</b> measurement node-types available:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>CONF</b>igure: Intended to configure nodes. No functionality implemeneted on Zera devices -
                available just for compatibility.
            </li>
            <li><b>INIT</b>iate: Initializes the measurement.</li>
            <li>
                <b>FETC</b>h?: This query returns the requested result. When executed multiple times, it will
                return same result unless <b>INIT</b>iate is called.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two <b>composite</b> measurement node-types available:
        <ol>
            <li><b>READ</b>: It is a sequence of <b>INIT</b>iate and <b>FETC</b>h.</li>
            <li>
                <b>MEAS</b>ure?: It is a sequence of <b>CONF</b>igure, <b>INIT</b>iate and <b>FETC</b>h.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        In the tables below, <b>MEAS</b>ure commands are mentioned for illustration. To use other nodes,
        for example replace <b>MEAS</b>ure by <b>READ</b> .
    </p>

    <p>
        Several measurement modules generate actual values. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                To read out dedicated single values, the node must be fully specified within the command.
                For example, to read out the voltage for channel UL1 the associated command is MEASure:RMS1:UL1? 
                Output format is RMS1:UL1:[V]:value; 
            </li>
            <li>
                To read out group of values, parent nodes can be specified within the command.
                For example, MEAS:RMS1? reads out all the RMS values.
            </li>
            <li>
                To read out all measurement values from the device, use <b>MEAS</b>ure? command.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Following sections explain the measuring systems supported by this device. Each measurement section has two tables:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Configuration:</b> Lists all possible configurations/settings available for that measurement system.
                These configurations can be read and modified.
            </li>
            <li><b>Values:</b> These SCPI-queries provide measured values.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
