        The following commands are available:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Status:</b>
            <p>
                Querying the error calculators status will give the following result. For more details, refer to the
                status line in the table below.<br/>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Progress:</b>
            <p>
                When a measurement is running, its progress can be read. The value is between
                0[%] and 100[%] .
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Result:</b>
            <p>
                When the device is in READY state a valid result in [%] can be read.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Reference input: Power module name (REFSOURCE):</b>
            <p>
                The reference power source (powermodule) can be queried and selected.
                Valid parameters are P (active power), Q (reactive power) and S (apparent power).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>MRate:</b>
            <p>
                The number of scanning head impulses for meter error measurement can be queried
                and set. Values can be up to 2<sup>32</sup> - 1.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>DUT source:</b>
            <p>
                The source of the device under test can be queried and selected. Valid parameters are
                <b>SC1</b> and <b>HK1</b>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>DUT constant:</b>
            <p>
                The meter constant of the device under test can be queried an set here. It's a floating point value.
                For active power measurement the device assumes the unit 1/kwh, for reactive power 1/kVarh and
                for apparent power 1/kVAh.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Start:</b>
            <p>
                With this command the measurement can be started and stopped as well.
                Writing a 1 starts the measurement, writing a 0 stops the measurement.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
