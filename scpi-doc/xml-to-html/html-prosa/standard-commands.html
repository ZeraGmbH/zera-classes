                The Clear Status command clears the deviceâ€™s status structures. This includes the following:<br/>
                - all event registers summarised in the Status Byte, including<br/>
                - the Standard Event Status register<br/>
                - the Operation Event register<br/>

                - the Error/Event Queue<br/>
                - sets the device in the Operation Complete Command Idle state<br/>

            <p>
                The Standard Event Status Enable command specifies the bit values of the Standard
                Event Status Enable register. This register determines which events from the
                Standard Event Status register are summarised in bit 5, the Event Summary Bit
                (ESB) of the Status Byte register.<br/>
                A bit value of 1 in the Standard Event Status Enable register selects the event at the
                corresponding bit position in the Standard Event Status register to be reported in the
                Event Summary Bit.<br/>
                The parameter associated with the "ESE command is to be specified as a decimal
                using the NRf format. When rounded to an integer value and expressed in base 2
                (binary), the parameter represents the bit values of the Standard Event Status
                Enable register.<br/>
                <b>Note:</b> Formally, a non-decimal numeric value is not allowed. However, rather than
                generating a Command Error, instruments may accept a non-decimal numeric value
                as a legal parameter data type. Because register bit settings can be best expressed
                as a hexadecimal value, this is a more user-friendly programming practice.

            <p>
                The Standard Event Status Enable query returns a decimal value, which reflects the
                bit values of the Standard Event Status Enable register when expressed in base 2.
                The returned value is a NR1 response data type.

            <p>
                The Standard Event Status Register query returns a decimal value, which reflects the
                bit values of the Standard Event Status Register when expressed in base 2. The
                returned value is a NR1 response data type. The *ESR? query causes the Standard
                Event Status register to be cleared.

        <li><b>*IDN? :</b>

                The Identification query is used to identify the instrument within a system. The
                response to the *IDN? is an &lt;instrument_identifier&gt; which is organised into four fields
                separated by commas (, 2Chex).
                The overall length of the response is less than 72 characters. The returned fields
                may use any ASCII characters in the range 20hex to 7Ehex, except commas (,2Chex)
                and semicolons (;3Bhex)

        <li><b>*OPC :</b>
            <p>
                The Operation Complete command allows for message synchronisation between a
                controller and one or more devices. The receipt of the <b>*OPC</b> command causes the
                instrument to set the Operation Complete bit (OPC, bit 0) in the Standard Event
                Status register to True when all selected pending operations are terminated. This
                implies that all device operations initiated by previously executed programming
                commands have been entirely completed or aborted. A power-on cycle, a 'device
                clear active state' message, a <b>*CLS</b> or a <b>*RST</b> will reset the OPC signalling
                mechanism.<br/>
                The <b>*OPC</b> command is to be sent as the last message unit in a terminated program
                message. The <b>*OPC</b>  operation may not function properly if other commands follow
                the <b>*OPC</b> command.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>*OPC?:</b>
            <p>
                This is a serial device, that means <b>*OPC</b> query always returns the ASCII character 1.
                In a non serial device the Operation Complete query allows for message
                synchronisation between a controller and one or more devices. The receipt of the
                <b>*OPC</b> query causes the instrument to place the ASCII character 1 (31hex) in the
                Output Queue when all selected pending operations are terminated. This implies that
                all device operations initiated by previously executed programming commands have
                been entirely completed or aborted. A power-on cycle, a 'device clear active state'
                message, a <b>*CLS</b> or a <b>*RST</b> will reset the OPC signalling mechanism.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Service Request Enable command specifies the bit values of the Service
                Request Enable register. This register determines which conditions from the Status
                Byte register:<br/>
                - will cause a Service Request (SRQ) interrupt<br/>
                - are summarised in the Master Summary Status (MSS, bit 6) of the status Byte
                register<br/>
                A bit value of 1 in the Service Request Enable register selects the condition in the
                corresponding Status Byte register position which will cause the SRQ interrupt and is
                summarised in the MSS bit. The value of bit position 6 in the Status Byte register
                (RQS/ MSS) is ignored.<br/>
                The parameter associated with the *SRE command is specified as a decimal using
                the NRf format. When rounded to an integer value and expressed in base 2 (binary),
                this parameter represents the bit value of the Standard Event Status Enable register.<br/>
                <b>Note:</b>  Formally, a non-decimal numeric value is not allowed. However, rather than

                The Service Request Enable query returns a decimal value, which reflects the bit
                values of the Service Request Enable register when expressed in base 2. The
                returned value is an NR1 response data type. The value of bit position 6 is always set
                to 0. SCPI instruments may implement the FORMat:SREGister command to allow for
                the selection of other response data types.

        <li><b>*STB?:</b>

                The Read Status Byte query returns a decimal value, which reflects the bit values of
                the Status Byte register when expressed in base 2. At bit position 6, the Master
                Summary Status (MSS) is returned. The returned result is an NR1 response data
                type. Executing the <b>*STB?</b> query does not directly affect the contents of the Status
                Byte register. SCPI instruments may implement the FORMat:SREGister command to
                allow for the selection of other response data types.

                The SeIf-Test query allows the user to perform an internal self-test of the instrument
                and to retrieve the test result. The execution of the self-test does not require any
                interaction with a local operator.<br/>
                The response to the <b>*TST?</b> query is a decimal numeric, using the NR1 data type. A
                returned value of zero (0) indicates that the test successfully completed without any
                errors detected. A returned non-zero value indicates that the test did not complete or
                did complete with errors detected.
