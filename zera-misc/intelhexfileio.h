/**
  @brief
  cIntelHexFileIO is a class to support intel hex file io management.

  It reads intel hex format from a given file and reports detected errors.
  While reading the file it fills a list with all memory regions found.
  Afterwards user can request memory regions to fill.
  orig. written for mfc, later ported to qt4 by Peter Lohmer (p.lohmer@zera.de)
